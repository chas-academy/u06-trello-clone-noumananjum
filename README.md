# U06 Trello Clone

>In this assignment, you will build an application that works as a "kanban board", similar to e.g. [trello.com](https://trello.com/). Only frontend and no backend are to be implemented.

## Requirements

As a user, you should be able to do the following:
- [x] Draw "cards" between three different "columns" (todo, doing, done)
- [x] Click on a card to see its information (dialog)
- [x] Click different tabs in a card to get more information about it (tabs)
- [x] Set a deadline on each card (datepicker)

The finished solution must implement:
- [x] JQuery UI datepicker
- [x] JQuery UI draggable and droppable (or sortable)
- [x] JQuery UI dialog
- [x] JQuery UI tabs
- [x] At least two effects of your choice from JQuery UI
- [x] At least one custom created simple JQuery UI Widget
- [x] Layout / disposition completely created from a CSS framework (optional)
